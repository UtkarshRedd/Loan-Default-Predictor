# Loan-Default-Predictor
This project was conducted to understand how to handle severely imbalanced datasets for supervised classification. Very extensive univariate and multivariate analysis has been conducted in this project along with data augmentation techniques like Synthetic Minority Oversampling. Several Machine Learning algorithms have been employed for loan default classification and tuned using GridSearchCV.
